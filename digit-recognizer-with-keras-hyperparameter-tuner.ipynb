Introduction \n","The indea in this notebook is to improve the \"Hello world\" of machine learning using [Keras tuner](https://github.com/keras-team/keras-tuner). To save precious time and to speed up and simplify the process of choosing the right hyperparameters of the model, it is possible to use a tuner. Kera's relatively new library is well suited for this. It allows to automatically play through different parameters and at the end - very conveniently - spits out the desired number of best models. These can then be processed in the further course. \n","\n","**Hyperparameter tuning is a time consuming process. This also applies to the automated version.
